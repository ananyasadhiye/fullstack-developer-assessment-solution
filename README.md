## 📌 Overview

This repository contains my solution to a coding challenge I attempted on June 6th, 2024. Despite technical issues faced during the official assessment, I implemented the logic-based solution independently on June 7th using Python.

The challenge required identifying the most frequent keys in a list of key-value pairs and filtering them out.

Given a list of key-value strings, remove entries with keys that appear most frequently.

Input: ["A:1", "B:2", "A:2", "C:3"]
Output: "B:2,C:3"
